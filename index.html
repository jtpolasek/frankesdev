                    The Name Frank E’s is a homage to my father Frank and my brother Erik. The E in the name is for my brother Big E (because
                    his son, my nephew, is called little e). Throughout my career and life these two men have always supported
                    me. Sometimes, like all relationships between father and sons and brothers, we have had many differences,
                    but throughout it all, they have always been there for me. They are both fathers, sons and brothers and
                    I admire them both for various reasons...
                    <span class="read-more-target">
                        My father has always encouraged me and introduced me to music, books, art and most of all a quality of life that helped mold
                        me into who I am today. My brother is a man who approaches his interests with tenacity and sincerity
                        to get a job well done. He embodies the qualities of being a great father that I experienced from
                        our father. This is a thank you to them for always being there when I needed them...Telling me what
                        I needed to hear not what I wanted to hear. The shop is the place where I can make time stop and
                        we can make time to be together As a son and brother to these two good men, it makes me proud just
                        to be around them. We all our busy but Frank E’s is a place where a man will be able to, for a period
                        of time, hang his hat and leave his troubles at the door, have a sip of whiskey and enjoy the banter
                        of being men. Here I want to create an environment where all generations of men can feel at ease,
                        have a great experience and at the same time get a haircut that will leave him feeling better than
                        when he came through the door. In this day and age, sometimes everything is too rushed. At Frank
                        E’s, quality and the experience is paramount.</span>

                        <p class="u-margin-bottom-small">Well-established in the San Francisco Bay Area, Michael Mejia is
                            a licensed barber and cosmetologist of 20 years, specializing in a new genre of old-school style—what
                            he calls ‘Modern-Classic’. Traditional to the core, Mejia specializes in bespoke haircuts that
                            are bringing handsome back. His unique craftsmanship has created a secret gentleman’s society
                            of sorts, where men gather for much-needed downtime and QT. It’s a rare-ifed kind of grooming
                            that harkens back to an era of Elvis, Frank Sinatraand Steve McQueen. On the menu? Hot shaves
                            and nostalgic banter. On the play list? Chet Baker, Chuck Berry, Frank Sinatra and other suave
                            crooners of yore. But what does the past have to do with modern style? In a word: everything.
                            “I’m channeling that same attention to detail and the same iconic looks. They’re dashing. Debonair.
                            There’s a soul and sense of pride in every detail,” he says. Time spent in his chair is time
                            immersed in badassery. Emerge a better man—with your best hair ever.</p>
                        <p class="u-margin-bottom-small"> Over the last decade, Mejia’s portfolio and client list has grown
                            to include athletes, Coachella performers, New York Fashion Week models and average gents seeking
                            to ‘up the ante’ on their everyday vibe. He got his start for hair brands Sebastian and label.m,then
                            became one of the original educators for Baxter. He’s still onboard helping to create the ever-evolving
                            curriculum and teach hands-on men’s haircutting techniques. Recently he signed on as a Global
                            Educator for Andis Clippers. His portfolio is a testament to his incurable perfectionism, listening
                            skills and careful precision (an inch is an inch—amen).
